# Senti Menti UI

Frontend for Senti Menti app, built with ShadCN and NextJS 13.

## Usage

Requires node v18+

```bash
npm i
npx run dev
```

1. Create an account named admin
2. Go to settings, add a ticker
3. Collect news for the ticker by pressing the collect button ( This would happen with a CRON job, but I cant afford the api usage)
4. Analyze the news by pressing the analyze button
5. Go the the dashboard, and view the results.
6. You may add multiple tickers but $$$
